Design Choices in Kubernetes Deployment Script Implementation

1. Modular Structure: 
   The script is organized into modular functions for each key operation, such as deploying resources, monitoring health, 
   creating namespaces, and setting up the metrics server. This design enhances code readability, maintainability, 
   and allows for easy modification or expansion of individual functionalities.

2. Cluster Connection and Configuration:
   The script initializes a connection to the Kubernetes cluster using `config.load_kube_config()` and encapsulates 
   connection steps within `connect_to_cluster()`. This abstraction allows for reuse and easy handling of connection errors, 
   ensuring that subsequent operations run on a connected cluster.

3. Deployment and Resource Configuration:
   - The deployment and service specifications are parameterized, allowing users to customize key parameters like image, 
     CPU/memory requests and limits, ports, and autoscaling thresholds through command-line arguments. 
   - Deployment resources (replicas, CPU/memory limits) are set up within the deployment specification, and resource usage 
     is then monitored through integration with Kubernetes metrics.

4. Autoscaling and Metrics Management:
   - The script installs and configures the Kubernetes Metrics Server, allowing HPA to scale the deployment based on CPU 
     and memory usage.
   - Autoscaling targets are configurable (e.g., `cpu_target`, `memory_target`), and the script includes a method to check 
     HPA readiness before proceeding with scaling operations.

5. Health Monitoring:
   - A `get_deployment_health_status` function provides a comprehensive view of the deployment status, including pod statuses, 
     CPU and memory usage, and any active issues or failures. This detailed health report is useful for real-time diagnostics.
   - Pod metrics are obtained either through the Kubernetes API or via `kubectl top` commands, ensuring compatibility in 
     environments where different levels of access to the metrics server might be present.

6. Error Handling and Resource Existence Checks:
   - Namespace and deployment existence checks are included, reducing the likelihood of conflicts by verifying the status of 
     resources before creating or replacing them.
   - Error handling is built into subprocess and Kubernetes API calls, providing clear feedback when something goes wrong 
     (e.g., if the metrics server isnâ€™t available).

7. CLI Argument Parsing:
   The script uses `argparse` to enable users to specify their desired configuration via command-line arguments. This choice 
   makes the script highly flexible and easy to integrate into CI/CD pipelines, where different configurations might be needed 
   in different environments.

By designing the script with modular, reusable functions, parameterization for flexibility, and detailed health checks, the 
implementation aims to provide a robust, scalable, and maintainable approach for deploying and managing Kubernetes resources 
with automated monitoring and scaling capabilities.
